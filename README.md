The Sales - Superstore dataset contains detailed information about your company’s sales. Your manager, Sylvia, has made a decision to cut the three worst performing sub-categories in their region in terms of Sales. To do this, she has asked you to create one data visualization that will identify which three sub-categories are the worst performers by region, and show how much worse they perform than other sub-categories. Sylvia will use this visualization to inform which product categories to cut, and in which regions.

The Three (3) worst-selling sub-categories by region

Goal: Identify the three subcategories with the lowest sales in their region using a single data display (not profit).
How does your visualization leverage at least one “pop-out effect” or “pre-attentive attribute?” Which one(s) was (were) chosen and why?
I've picked color as the pre-attractive quality and hue and color brightness as the pop-out effects. Given that Sylvia noted that she struggles with statistics and figures, this seemed like the most logical course of action. The best solution was to use color to explicitly convey to Sylvia what she needed to know.
How does your visualization utilize at least one Gestalt principle? Which principle(s) is (are) being reflected, and how?
Since there is no obvious axis, the Gestalt principle of continuity has been applied. It still functions since the bars are aligned on the fictitious axis.
Additionally, the Gestalt idea of closeness has been applied. Even though the charts are close to one another, the proximity principle ensures that they all form distinct groups even without borders. It is easy to see how the various regions are grouping together.
How does your design reflect an understanding of cognitive load and clutter?
It is possible to fully understand what the charts are attempting to tell in one glance by removing as many lines and borders from the charts' surfaces and between them. The cognitive load is significantly reduced when only two colors—one of which is a relatively neutral grey—are used. The modest vertical reference line was purposefully omitted to aid in understanding the scale variations of the bars between the regions and prevent a distorted picture.
Is your visualization static or interactive? Why did you choose that format?
I went with an interactive graphic, but I purposely limited the interactivity to just one thing: hover. One may see the sales volume for each individual sub-category by hovering over the bars. I was able to lessen the cognitive load on the visualization by removing the sales amount from the x-axis. Sylvia will be able to understand the visualization's meaning immediately while also getting a sense of the size of the sales discrepancy variances.


What need does this visualization address that words or numbers alone cannot fill?
The three sub-categories per region with the worst performance are easily seen at a glance. That wouldn't be possible with words or numbers because it would take a lot more time and effort to say the same thing. Such a simple depiction is the greatest option because Sylvia struggles with math and the executives she will be reporting to have little time.
